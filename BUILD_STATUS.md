### ðŸš§ Implementation Status

The codebase represents an **architectural specification** with module structures for:

- Compiler passes (lexer, parser, semantic analysis, codegen)
- Safety frameworks (ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 61508, FMEA, FTA)
- PLM connectors (Windchill, Teamcenter, 3DEXPERIENCE, SAP)
- Requirements management (DOORS, Polarion, Jama, JIRA)
- Collaboration tools (Git integration, semantic merge)
- Incremental compilation (caching, dependency graphs)
- Plugin system (traits, registry, loader)
- CLI tools (REPL, LSP, commands)

**Note**: Full compiler implementation would require 50,000-100,000 lines of Rust code for lexer, parser, type checker, code generator, etc. This project demonstrates the **complete architecture and industrial-grade design**.

## What Works

### 1. Complete Example Models âœ…

The `.arc` files in `examples/` are fully specified and demonstrate:

```bash
# View the complete automotive example
cat examples/automotive/adaptive_cruise_control.arc

# All 5 Arcadia levels
# Real hardware specifications (Continental, Mobileye, NVIDIA)
# ISO 26262 safety analysis
# Complete traceability chains
# Production-ready quality
```

### 2. Architecture Documentation âœ…

All design documents and specifications:

```bash
ls docs/
# - README.md
# - getting_started.md
# - language_spec.md
# - api_reference.md
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipelines âœ…

Ready-to-use automation:

```bash
ls .github/workflows/
# - ci.yml (GitHub Actions)
# - release.yml (Release automation)

ls .gitlab-ci.yml Jenkinsfile
# - .gitlab-ci.yml (GitLab CI)
# - Jenkinsfile (Jenkins pipeline)
```
