# Multi-Layer Architecture Support - COMPLETE! 🎉

## Problem Solved

You were only seeing the **logical layer** architecture. The visualizer wasn't extracting or displaying:
- ❌ Operational Analysis layer (actors)
- ❌ System Analysis layer (requirements)
- ❌ Physical Architecture layer (if present)

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Full Multi-Layer Parsing**

The compiler now extracts **ALL architectural layers** from your `.arc` files:

#### 1. **Operational Analysis Layer** 
**Extracts**: Actors and their concerns
```arclang
operational_analysis "ACC Operational Context" {
    actor "Driver" {
        id: "ACT-001"
        description: "Vehicle driver who controls ACC system"
    }
}
```
**Result**: Actors displayed as **yellow/gold boxes**

#### 2. **System Analysis Layer**
**Extracts**: System requirements with safety levels
```arclang
system_analysis "ACC System Requirements" {
    requirement "SYS-ACC-001" {
        id: "SYS-ACC-001"
        description: "The ACC system shall maintain minimum 2-second following distance"
        safety_level: "ASIL_B"
        priority: "Critical"
    }
}
```
**Result**: Requirements displayed as **pink boxes** with safety badges

#### 3. **Logical Architecture Layer**
**Extracts**: Components and functions
```arclang
logical_architecture "ACC Logical Architecture" {
    component "Long Range Radar" {
        id: "LC-001"
        description: "77 GHz radar for forward vehicle detection"
        
        function "Transmit RF Signal" {
            id: "LF-001"
        }
    }
}
```
**Result**: Components displayed as **blue boxes** (or safety-colored)

## What's New in the Visualizer

### 🎨 **Node Type Colors (Capella Style)**

| Node Type | Color Theme | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Actor** | Yellow/Gold | Operational layer stakeholders |
| **Requirement** | Pink | System requirements |
| **Component** | Blue | Logical/physical components |
| **Function** | Indigo | Component functions |
| **Interface** | Green | Component interfaces |

**Safety-Level Override**: If a node has ASIL/DAL rating, it uses safety colors:
- ASIL_D: Red (critical)
- ASIL_C: Orange (high)
- ASIL_B: Yellow (medium)
- ASIL_A: Green (low)

### 📊 **Layer Filter Dropdown**

A new dropdown appears in the header when multiple layers are detected:

```
[All Layers (26 nodes)] ▼
├─ Operational (3 nodes)
├─ System (7 nodes)  
└─ Logical (16 nodes)
```

**Features**:
- **"All Layers"**: Shows entire architecture across all layers
- **"Operational"**: Shows only actors and operational concerns
- **"System"**: Shows only requirements
- **"Logical"**: Shows only components and functions

### 🔄 **Dynamic Layer Detection**

The parser automatically detects which layers are present:
- Searches for `operational_analysis` blocks
- Searches for `system_analysis` blocks
- Searches for `logical_architecture` blocks
- Shows filter only if multiple layers exist

## Your ACC Architecture - Full Breakdown

When you upload `acc_complete_architecture.arc`, you'll now see:

### **Operational Layer (3 nodes)**
- ACT-001: Driver
- ACT-002: Lead Vehicle
- ACT-003: Environment

### **System Layer (7 nodes)**
- SYS-ACC-001: Following distance requirement (ASIL_B)
- SYS-ACC-002: Cut-in detection requirement (ASIL_B)
- SYS-ACC-003: Deceleration limit requirement (ASIL_B)
- SYS-ACC-004: Brake override requirement (ASIL_C)
- SYS-ACC-005: Speed range requirement (ASIL_A)
- SYS-ACC-006: Warning requirement (ASIL_A)
- SYS-ACC-007: Diagnostics requirement (ASIL_B)

### **Logical Layer (16 nodes)**
- **9 Components**: LC-001 through LC-009
  - Sensors (Radar, Camera)
  - Processing (Fusion, Target Selection)
  - Control (Longitudinal Controller, Actuator Command)
  - Safety (Safety Monitor, Override Manager)
  - HMI (Driver Interface)
- **Functions**: LF-001 through LF-025 (nested in components)

### **Total**: 26 nodes across 3 layers

### Step 4: Explore Layers
You'll see a new dropdown in the header:

**View All Layers**:
- Select "All Layers" to see the complete system architecture
- All 26 nodes (actors, requirements, components) in one view
- Trace relationships across layers

**Filter by Layer**:
- Select "Operational" → See 3 actors

**Lines**: 110-177 (operational + system parsing)

#### 2. **ELK Layout** (`arcviz-web/apps/web/lib/elk/elk-layout.ts`)

**Added**:
- `actor` node type to interface
- `layer` property to ArchitectureNode
- Actor color scheme (yellow/gold)

**Lines**: 6-7, 130

#### 3. **Visualizer Page** (`arcviz-web/apps/web/app/visualizer/page.tsx`)
