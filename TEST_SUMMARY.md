# ArcLang Test Suite Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive test suite for the ArcLang MBSE compiler with **63 passing tests** covering all major components.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Lexer Tests (33 tests)
**Location:** `tests/lexer_tests.rs`

Tests tokenization and lexical analysis:
- String literals with decimals and special characters
- Keywords recognition (model, system, requirements, architecture)
- Operators (dot notation, arrows, colons)
- Component interface notation
- Safety standards and identifiers
- Complete ACC model tokenization

### 2. Parser Tests (9 tests)
**Location:** `tests/parser_tests.rs`

Tests parsing of ArcLang syntax:
- Minimal model structure
- Requirements blocks (stakeholder, system, safety)
- Architecture blocks (logical, physical, operational)
- Component definitions
- Connection blocks with from/to attributes
- Nested interface blocks
- Multiple requirement types
- Keyword handling (from, to as both keywords and identifiers)

Key test cases:
```arc
test_parse_requirements_block
test_parse_architecture_logical  
test_parse_connections
test_parse_from_to_keywords
```

### 3. Semantic Analysis Tests (7 tests)
**Location:** `tests/semantic_tests.rs`

Tests semantic model construction:
- Basic semantic analysis
- Interface collection from connections
- Multiple requirements aggregation
- Component level tracking (logical/physical)
- Requirement attributes (description, priority, safety_level)
- Empty model handling
- Metrics computation

Key validations:
- Requirements count
- Components count
- Interfaces count
- Traceability metrics

### 4. Integration Tests (9 tests)
**Location:** `tests/integration_tests.rs`

Tests end-to-end compilation:
- Minimal model compilation
- Requirements parsing and collection
- Architecture parsing and component extraction
- Connection/interface handling
- Full system model with all features
- Multiple architecture types
- Quoted requirement IDs
- Nested component interfaces
- Unknown token handling (parser leniency)

Example test:
```rust
test_compile_full_system // Complete ACC system with requirements, components, connections
```

### 5. Existing ACC Model Tests (5 tests)
**Location:** `tests/test_full_acc_model.rs`

Tests specific ACC use cases:
- Component.Interface notation
- Properties blocks
- Safety level identifiers
- Decimal values in strings
- Complete ACC model tokenization

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

### Run specific test suite:
```bash
cargo test --test parser_tests
cargo test --test semantic_tests
cargo test --test integration_tests
```

### Run with output:
```bash
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Test Results

All 63 tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Lexer: 33/33 passed
- ✅ Parser: 9/9 passed
- ✅ Semantic: 7/7 passed
- ✅ Integration: 9/9 passed
- ✅ ACC Model: 5/5 passed

## Key Features Tested

1. **Requirements Management**
   - Multiple requirement types (stakeholder, system, safety)
   - Requirement attributes (description, priority, safety_level)
   - Quoted IDs with hyphens (e.g., "REQ-001")

2. **Architecture Blocks**
   - Logical architecture with components
   - Physical architecture support
   - Operational architecture (skipped gracefully)

3. **Connections/Interfaces**
   - Connection blocks with from/to attributes
   - Interface collection in semantic model
   - Nested component interfaces (provides/requires)

4. **Parser Robustness**
   - Handles from/to as both keywords and identifiers
   - Skips unknown tokens gracefully
   - Parses top-level blocks after model declaration

5. **Semantic Model**
   - Collects requirements, components, interfaces
   - Computes metrics (counts, traceability)
   - Validates element relationships

## Notes

- IDs with hyphens must be quoted: `req "REQ-001"` not `req REQ-001`
- Parser is lenient with unknown tokens (skips them)
- `from:` and `to:` work as both keywords and identifiers
- Architecture operational blocks are skipped (not fully implemented)

## Recent Fixes

1. ✅ Parser now continues parsing after model block ends
2. ✅ Requirements blocks (stakeholder/system/safety) are parsed
3. ✅ Connection blocks create interfaces in semantic model
4. ✅ Component nested interfaces are skipped properly
5. ✅ From/To keywords handled in connection parsing
